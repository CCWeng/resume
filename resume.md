### Career Progression

*   **Product Developer**, ACTi Corp.,
    Aug. 2012 - 2015
    - My job is to design computer vision algorithms for various surveillance and business service applications. I am mainly incharge of pedestrian and car detection. Besides, I also support algorithm review for moving object tracking, license plate recognition, heat map analysis and so on.
    - As a senior developer, I am also responsible for providing the intial algorithm sketch based on the custom's requirement, hosting the team meeting and assigning corresponding tasks.

### Representative Projects

*  **Surveillance Applications**, ACTi Corp.
	- Develope applications including tripwire, forbidden area, missing/unattended object detection, incorrect direction detection and crowd analysis. 

*  **People Counting**, ACTi Corp.
	- Detect and count the number of people entering and exiting the store for client *New World Design Center* [(http://www.new-world.com.tw)](http://www.new-world.com.tw).

*	**Answer Sheet Recognition**, Private, Aug. 2015 - Oct. 2015  
	- Recognize the marked options from cell phone camera image for client *Study123* [(https://www.study123.com.tw)](https://www.study123.com.tw).
