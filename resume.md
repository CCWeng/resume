---------------------------------------

### Summary

*   My research field is about **Robotics Navigation**.
	- particularly, it is moving object tracking introducing neighboring (object) interaction model and scene interaction model. 
*   Familiar with **Machine Learning**.
	- have ever implemented SVM, RealAdaBoost, TreeCascade for detecting objects which are of the same category but with various appearance, such as cars and pedestrians.
*   Have **Computer Vision** background knowledge.
	- learned about vision-based perception issues, which include features, camera model and 3D object shape recovery, from working or taking online courses.

---------------------------------------

### Work Experience

*   **Product Developer**, ACTi Corp.,
    Aug. 2012 - current
    - Design image algorithms for surveillance and business service. I am mainly incharge of pedestrian and car detection.
    - Support developments of moving object tracking and license plate recognition.
    - Complete corresponding applications such as tripwire, forbidden area, incorrect direction detection and crowd analysis.
    - Port and maintain algorithm packages under ACTi IVS(Intelligent Video System) framework.
