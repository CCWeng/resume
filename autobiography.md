During 3 years as a software engineer with Algorithm Section in Micro-star International CO., Ltd., my main responsibilities were to develop consumer electronics products especially autonomous vacuum robot. Our team developed customized robot software and human-robot interface; we also launched multiple field tests to ensure great quality. In addition, I built software architecture for high-end product and made the vacuum robot being capable of localizing and navigating accurately in indoor environment.

In my two-year graduate school period before joining MSI, research interest included Robot Perception, Machine Learning and Digital Image Processing. My thesis and conference publication were about localization and mapping in dynamic environments for autonomous robot with a monocular camera. With new mathematical model and filtering approach, performance of the localization and mapping is enhanced in both simulation and real environment. The results were published in 2011 IEEE ICRA Conference.

I Love to join Open source and Open data communities and make contributions. I believe information technology would change people’s lives. "Hacker News" is a must-read website in my leisure time. A bunch of inspiring articles show up in the top list everyday. Great entrepreneurs and programmers share cool ideas or products on the platform. This influences me so I set my next goal: build the next influential product and make a difference.

Specialties: Robot Perception and Learning, Algorithm Design, Artificial Intelligence, Probabilistic Model.
